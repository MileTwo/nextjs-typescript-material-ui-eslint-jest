Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms. Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work alongside ESLint's built-in rules. You can customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.`,
